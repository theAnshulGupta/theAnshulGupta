Hey! I'm Anshul, a Sophomore in the Bay Area. Welcome to my Github! As a coder, I love full-stack development and have made several websties. Most notably, I've co-founded AUesome (https://auesome.co), a company combining the physical a virtual world for childrenw with autism for at-home therapy. Also, I've helped form ThetaHacks (https://thetahacks.tech), a high school hackathon in the Bay Area.

<br>
I fell in love with coding when COVID's Quarantine began -- back in March 2020. For years before (and still now) I have participated in several mechanical engineering groups, including as CNC Operator, CADder, and Subystems Build Team Member in my FRC Team.

<br>
But before you think I only code for a living (which, honestly I wouldn't mind you thinking), I also consider myself an Entrepreneur, since I'm able to spell that word without making a typo. I was a student in LaunchX (formerly MIT LaunchX) where I created AUesome with my team. We were ranked 3rd out of 63 teams and won the website and several pitch contests. Be sure to check out my LinkedIn for more info.

<br>
And yes, I am musically oriented. I play percussion and piano both inside and outside of school. Currently, I'm the section leader of my Wind Ensemble.
